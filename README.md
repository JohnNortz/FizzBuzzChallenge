FizzBuzz Challenge

Program is run in console as a default ruby script

The program will iterate through the first 50,000 positive integers.

after starting the script, you will be prompted enter your desired number-word pairs. Number first then Word.

pressing enter without input durring the number selection will start the iteration and the results will print to console.

Order matters. The order the pair is entered will be the same order that it will appear in the output string if multiple pairs fire on the same number iteration

Example: Entering [3,fizz,5,buzz] will print 'fizzbuzz' on iteration 15, however entering [5,buzz,3,fizz] will print 'buzzfizz' on 15.

duplicates are allowed and order is still maintained
Example: entering [3,buzz, 5,fizz, 3,sivv] will print 'buzzfizzsivv' on 15
